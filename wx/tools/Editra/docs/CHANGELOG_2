#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
VERSION 0.1.78
DATE 09/01/2007
5th Alpha Release

NEWS:
This version of Editra has support for a Vim Emulation mode that emulates
Vim's Input and Normal modes. A good majority of Vi Normal Mode commands are 
currently supported with more to come in future releases.

There is also a new plugin interface available to work with in this version.
The new interface is called 'The Shelf' its provides an easy interface for 
plugins that want to allow multiple copies of their interface by managing the
panes in a notebook that is docked by default to the bottom of the editor. The 
Shelf can also be repositioned or pulled out to a separate floating window and
saved in that position through the perspectives manager in the view menu.

instances to be opened at once in a notebook interface.

VERSION 0.1.64
DATE 07/27/2007
4th Alpha Release

NEWS:
Thanks to everyone who reported errors and problems in the last release I was
able to tie up a number loose ends and error cases in the programs operation.

Major changes to profile system, the view of the the profile should not be much
different from the perspective of usage but the underlying system has been
completely rewritten to be more robust, reliable, and scalable. These changes
have made the Pyshell-v0.2 and FileBrowser-v0.1 incompatible with this new
version of Editra, however there are also new versions of both these plugins
that are compatible and bundled with the binary versions.

Some changes to the style sheet system have been made that make older syntax
style sheets incompatible with this version. If you are just using the builtin
styles there is no need to worry about this but if you have created a custom
style sheet you will need to change the font face definitions not to use the 
following format expressions (%(mono), %(helv), %(other), %(times)), and
instead use the new tags of (%(primary), %(secondary)) these expressions are
to ensure that the fonts that are set as the preferred fonts in the preference
dialog are used instead of the defaults when applicable.

NEW: [features/improvements]
+Improved notebook tab navigation
+Better Drag and Drop feedback for text and files
+Font preferences can be saved from session to session
+New User Profile system
+FileBrowser plugin is now bundled with Editra binary distrobutions
+Commandline option to enable debugging
+Error reporter can be disabled in the preference dialog

BUG FIXES:
+Handled some unhandled error conditions in the python autocompleter
+Fixed a bug where a save would fail when clicking on Yes when the modify save
 dialog was shown.
+Fixed a number of minor bugs in the plugin manager
+Fixed bug in the Preferences Dialog where some settings wouldn't get set
+Filehistory order is properly preserved
+Fixed a bug in the Style Editor where it would occasionally prompt for saving 
 when it didn't need to.
+Style Editor and Plugin Manager now properly use Metal style when it is set on
 OSX.
+Fixed a bug where the Find dialogs menu entries would get disabled after the
 first showing.

VERSION 0.1.0
DATE 05/24/2007
1st Alpha Release

NEWS:
  This is the first release in the alpha release series. The alpha releases will
probably continue until version 0.5.0 or so when the beta phase begins and 
most development energy will be shifted to stabilization of the editor and the 
api as well as improving performance to prepare for a 1.0 release. What can be 
expected during this alpha release series is the improvement of current features, 
a few new minor features and more thorough testing prior to a release which will 
lead to a more powerful, more stable and more usable program.

  The big addition to this version is the support for extensions to the editor
through plugins written in python. The plugins must be written and packaged
in a certain way for them to work, but the api is fairly easy to learn and
even easier to use. To learn more visit the documentation page at read the
plugins how to in the user documentation section. This version of the editor
comes with one plugin that can be used as an example of how to do things
as well.

  There is now a platform independent installer for Editra. It will install
Editra as a python package. To install Editra as a python package just issue
the following command from the command line in the source package base 
directory.

        python setup.py install

   This is of course assuming that python is on your path. On Windows you
may have to issue the command as follows. Where the XX is replaced with
the version number of python you have installed (i.e 24, 25, ect...)

        C:\\PythonXX\python.exe setup.py install

   This installation method is in its first iteration and probably has some 
compatibility issues, so please report bugs either on the bug tracker 
(code.google.com/issues/list) or on the community page (editra.org/?page=community)
to help improve it.
